This repository contains the python codes for "A High-Order Integrator for the Schr√∂dinger Equation with Time-Dependent, Homogeneous Magnetic Field" by V. Gradinaru and O. Rietmann.

**Running the examples**

To reproduce the figures of the work above, open a terminal and run

`python3 <example.py> <~/path/to/output/directory/>`

where `<example.py>` is replaced by one of the scripts, e.g. harmonic.py, and `<~/path/to/output/directory/>` is an existing directory where the figures are to be stored.
